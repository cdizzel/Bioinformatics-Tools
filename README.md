9Recomb.py is used to determine recombination rates in F2 offspring and determine whether or not they are in the coupling or repulsion phase. It will brute force solve for variable P which may take several hundred iterations. For more in-depth information please consult Hilgardia Vol.24 no.10 By Allard R. W. This program is designed for 9 inputs with AaBb and aAbB combined into one variable. 

Cmcalc.py will determine corrected map distances (CM) based on relative frequency (RF) inputs and log them to a CSV file of your choice.

These programs will run on Python with no dependencies.
